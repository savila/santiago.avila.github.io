[ Page Under Construction ]
======

I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the Department of Theoretical Physics of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid (UAM) and the Institute of Theoretical Physics (IFT UAM-CSIC). I am a cosmologist, which means I study the Universe as whole: its origin, evolution, content and physics. My field of expertise is the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe and the cosmological simulations. I study and model how the galaxies distribute in space and what information can we extract from galaxy surveys in order to better understand our Universe.
