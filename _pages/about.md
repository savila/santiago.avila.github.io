[ Page Under Construction ]
======

I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the Department of Theoretical Physics of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid (UAM) and the Institute of Theoretical Physics (IFT UAM-CSIC). I am a cosmologist, which means I study the Universe as whole: its origin, evolution, content and physics. My field of expertise is the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe and cosmological simulations. I study and model how galaxies distribute in space and what information we can extract from galaxy surveys in order to better understand our Universe.

International Collaborations
======

Current challenges in cosmology require the coherent effort of the entire community to be addressed. That is why a large portion of nowadays ground-breaking research is performed within large international collaborations, often with hundres of scientist involved. 
This is the list of collaborations in which I have been actively involved:

- Dark Energy Survey (DES, https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)
- extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) / SDSS-IV (https://www.sdss.org/)
- Euclid (https://sci.esa.int/web/euclid)
- Square Kilometer Array (SKA, https://www.skatelescope.org/)
- Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI, https://www.desi.lbl.gov/)
- UNIT simulations (UNITsims, http://www.unitsims.org/)




If you are a student who would like to start a project (BSc, MSc, PhD, TFM, TFG, ...) on these topics, please, get in touch.
