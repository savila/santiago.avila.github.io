I am a Ramón y Cajal research fellow working at the Centro de Investigaciones Eneréticas Medioambientales y Tecnológicas (CIEMAT), located at Ciudad Universitaria of Madrid. I am a cosmologist, which means I study the Universe as whole: its origin, evolution, content and physics. My field of expertise is the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe and cosmological simulations. I study and model how galaxies distribute in space and what information we can extract from galaxy surveys in order to better understand our Universe. Appart from research, I also [teach](https://savila.github.io/teaching/) and do [outreach](https://savila.github.io/outreach/).

International Collaborations
======

Current challenges in cosmology require the coherent effort of the entire community to be addressed. That is why a large portion of nowadays ground-breaking research is performed within large international collaborations, often with hundreds of scientist involved. 
This is the list of collaborations in which I have been actively involved:

- [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)
I am currently one of the two conveners of the Large Scale Structure (LSS) Science Working Group (SWG), in charge of Galaxy Clustering (GC), while we analyse the final dataset (Year-6 or Y6). The LSS-SWG is in charge of the whole BAO Key Project (KP), of providing the GC products for the 3x2pt (combined GC & WL) KP analysis and of other science projects related to GC such us the study of Primordial Non-Gaussianitties.

- [extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) / SDSS-IV](https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/eboss/)
I performed the Halo Occupation Distribution analysis for Emission Line Galaxies and I was involved in the ELG and general cosmology analsysis. I was also involved in the eBOSSxGBT analysis.  

- [Euclid](https://sci.esa.int/web/euclid).
I am currently one of the leads of the "Simulations for Galaxy Clustering" Work Package. Involved in the Simulations and Galaxy clustering SWG.

- [Square Kilometer Array (SKA)](https://www.skatelescope.org/)
I studied the viability and methodology of measuring BAO with SKA HI intensity mapping program in presence of observational (foreground and telescop beam) effects. 

- [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/). 
I generate mock catalogue with PNG. I am also involved in the ELG HOD.

- [UNIT simulations (UNITsims)](http://www.unitsims.org/)
I participated in the UNITsim-Galaxies project. 
I have led the PNG-UNITsim project ([abstracts](https://www.bsc.es/res-intranet/abstracts) 2021-3; 2022-2; 2022-3; 2023-1).
